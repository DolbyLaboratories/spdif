spdif v1.0 Readme.

The spdif program is an AC-3 or E-AC-3 file formatter that will wrap the frames in  
the S/PDIF format (including preamble words and zero-padding) 
such that the resulting output file can be played as PCM into any 
S/PDIF Dolby Digital receiver.  Alternately, the output file can be 
burned to a CD and played out of the digital output of a CD or DVD player.

Input AC-3 or E-AC-3 files must not have a framesize greater than 1532 words.
Note: bsmod will default to 0 for E-AC-3 files.

Usage: spdif [-h] [-i<filename.ext>] [-o<filename.ext>] [-a] [-v] [-d] [-n<#>]

Usage: SPDIF [-h] [-i<filename.ext>] [-o<filename.ext>] [-a] [-v] [-d] [-n<#>]
       -h     Show this usage message and abort
       -i     Input AC-3 or E-AC-3 file name (default output.ac3) (or .sdf if deformat)
       -o     Output SPDIF file name (default output.sdf) (or .ac3 if deformat)
       -a     Use alternate packing method - aligns 2/3 pt (not valid for E-AC-3 files)
       -v     Verbose mode. Display frame number and % done
       -fddp  Force DDPLUS style formatting (no effect for deformatting)
       -d     Deformat.  Output AC-3 file from SPDIF input file
       -n<#>  Change the SPDIF data_stream_number in the burst_info word.
              Use -n<stream#> for formatting only. stream# range:0-7. Default=0.

Release Notes v1.0
==================
* Code cleanup for open source release


Release Notes v0.9
==================
* Added -fddp command.  This will force DD bitstreams (.ac3) to be packed as DD+ bitstreams. 
  There is no need to specify this switch when defomating data (-d)


Release Notes v0.7
==================

* Added support forcorrect IEC header information for DD+

* Increased buffer sizes to incorporate higher bit rates allowed by DD+



Release Notes v0.6
==================

* Merged in support for handling EC3 streams with less than 6 blocks (from mblocks branch)

* Added new test cases for streams with less than 6 blocks

Release Notes v0.5
==================

* Added support for timecode stripping
SPDIF will skip over the timecode in the DD stream, and will output to the
spdif format without the timecode.

* Increased modularity using separate function for getting a timeslice

Release Notes v0.4
==================

* Added support for DD+ (E-AC-3) files
SPDIF will now look at the bsid to determine whether the file is DD
or DD+.  If DD+, it will default bsmod to 0, and will read in 
framesize directly from the bitstream.  The rest of the algorithm is
the same as with DD.

* Enhanced error checking
Will now error if framesize of the DD or DD+ frame is greater than 1532 words,
which will be 1532 + 4 (preamble) = 1536 words, the max framesize of DD over
SPDIF.  Also, will error if trying to use alternate packing with DD+ files.

* Added testing harness
